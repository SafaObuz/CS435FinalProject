Help me with the training.

My laptop only has 8 GB of RAM. It will take forever.

How to train:

You will run by command:

for example:

python train.py --batch_size 8 --num_epochs 20 --dataset_path './dataset' --save_model './model_epoch.pth' --num_workers 8


quite similar for evaluation


For the data set. I use the HR version on Kaggle.

You can use my downscale.py to generate the LR version.


Good luck.
